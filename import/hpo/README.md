## HPO 

Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) downloads are available from: https://hpo.jax.org/app/download/annotation

The above points to here: http://compbio.charite.de/jenkins/job/hpo.annotations/lastStableBuild/

This contains a `genes_to_phenotype.txt` csv which, as it turns out, simply repeats properties for diseases across genes associated with those diseases.  In other words, inheritance is only specific to diseases and the repitition in this file is simply for convenience.
